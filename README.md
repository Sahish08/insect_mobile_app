# insect_mobile_app

This repository contains code for a cross-platform (iOS/Android) mobile app.
The app takes pictures either from the user's photo library or their camera and classifies the insects in the image by making an asynchronous call to a Flask REST API, which contains the PyTorch classifier model.
